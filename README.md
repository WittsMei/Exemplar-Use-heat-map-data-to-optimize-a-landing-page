Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JiuZ9VAhbeyQ2d1E7ZR6HirJFDzi_iVz2JYCzKebEHI/edit#heading=h.d67ibxrsu3s0)

Let’s review each idea in the email:

### Idea 1: Move the signup form higher on the page
- **Problem**: Most customers leave the page without scrolling down far enough to find the form.

- **Heat map data used**: This idea draws on data from both heat maps to conclude that elements near the top of the page have greater engagement.

- **Solution**: Move the signup form up the page, so site visitors are more likely to find it.

### Idea 2: Reduce the number of fields
- **Problem**: Site visitors are abandoning the signup form at the halfway point.

- **Heat map data used**: This idea uses the click heat map, which indicates that engagement decreases with each field in the signup form.

- **Solution**: Reduce the number of fields in the signup form and find another way to collect the rest of the information.

### Idea 3: Make the form and CTA stand out more
- **Problem**: The signup form is too light and blends into its surroundings. 

- **Heat map data used**: The click map indicates that visitors are engaging more with nearby page elements. Some of those who are using the signup form are clicking in the wrong places.

- **Solution**: Make the form larger or bolder (or both) and turn the CTA from a link into a more noticeable button.

### Idea 4: Reduce overall page clutter
- **Problem**: There are so many page elements that visitors’ attention is divided. 

- **Heat map data used**: The click map indicates that visitor engagement across most of the page falls on the lower end of the heatmap scale.

- **Solution**: Focus visitor attention on the most important areas by removing some of the less important page elements.
